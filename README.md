Well hi there. I'm a wordpress theme called Malazar, I'm not built entirely from scratch, instead my foundation is the `underscores` package. This is the first wordpress theme build by Thomas Maker.  

The Underscores Theme is created by Automatic, which is the same company that brings us WordPress. By default, it generates all files and directories needed to begin a valid WordPress theme.
